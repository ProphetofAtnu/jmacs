# jmacs

A project for my own enjoyment. If you look at my repos, you will see my old emacs configuration. It's like, 15,000 lines long and it's fundimentally broken. I'm going to try and use what I leared by writing that to make a better configuration. 

# Who is this for?

Me. That's pretty much it. If anyone wants it, they can have it. 

If you intend to use this as a reference, here's some of the things you'll find:

- [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) for package management
- [general.el](https://github.com/noctuid/general.el) for keybindings
- The primary platforms I use this profile on are RHEL (at work) and MacOS (at home), so you will see some code dedicated to fixing issues that exist on both of those platforms
- I am trying to use LSP-mode _as sparingly as possible_
